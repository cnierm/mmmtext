I use the following to compile the binaries using g++:

g++ main.cpp Line.cpp -static -o mmmtext

FOR ONLINEGDB

I have added a safe mode that allows the program to work with onlineGDB. Make your terminal window a little taller for best results, but otherwise it should work even though it does not fill the width of the console.
